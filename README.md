# rust-rocket-web-server-rewrite

This is a rewrite from scratch of the rust-rocket-web-server functionality, in order to create it from memory and without looking up any of the reference material that was used to learn and make the original.

A simple front end might also potentially be added to this version as a way of extending it.
